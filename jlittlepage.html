<p>I currently work at MetroHealth Systems as a Systems Analyst.  I enjoy working at Metro because I learn something new everyday. Before working at Metro I lived in Fort. Lauderdale for several years. I moved back to the Cleveland area to be closer to my family. For fun I work part-time at the Hard Rock Rocksino.  I use the money earned at the Rocksino to fund my weekend trips back to Florida to visit my friends.  I am taking this class to learn more about Internet Programming and it is also a required class for the Programming and Development Post-Degree Professional Certificate which I am currently persuing.</p>
